        <p><b>The Forest Rights Act (FRA)</b>, officially known as the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, is a landmark legislation in India.

            <li><p><b>Resource Rights: </b>FRA provides local residents with rights to collect minor forest produce, grazing, and other resources.</p></li>

            <li><p><b>Forest Management Rights: </b>FRA gives the right to protect and conserve forest resources.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Importance</b></p>
